# swe-3133-spring-2025-team-6
Welcome to the project repository for team 6. Here you will find all of our presentations, documentation, and source code for our SWE 3313 class project.
We will be building an e-commerce site ASP.NET Core Blazor, with our data being stored in SQLite, that sells unique video game items. The project will allow users to create accounts to buy the items for sale, and it will contain admininstration capabilities to allow the administrator to add inventory and run sales reports.

## Project Plan
### Meet our Team:
- [Austin Hodge](/Resumes/AustinHodge.md)
- [Jay Jalla](/Resumes/JayJalla.md)
- Mark Cuzman
- Connor Craig
  
We began by deciding the language that best suited our experience. From there, we decided the framework and database storage that would be best suited for our needs, followed by the breakdown of roles for the project.
### Team Assignments
- To ensure each member has a part of the project to focus on, we separated into four roles: Project Lead, Software Architect, Front-End Developer, and Back-End Developer

### Technology Selection
- We are building our application using C# ASP.NET through Blazor Server. We will be using SQLite to store the data for users, administrators, and the items that will be hosted on the website.
